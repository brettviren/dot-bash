My bash setup, nothing really fancy here.

* Installation

Clone somewhere and symlink [[./bash_login]] and [[./bashrc]] to their "dot" equivalents in =$HOME/=.

* Organization

Put generic functions under [[./functions/]] and variable settings under [[./variables/]].  Any files there ending with =.sh= get loaded.
